# Synopsis 
This is a very basic Paper Scissors Rock game.  The intent of this program was to teach myself the basics of java, such as switches, the Random class, the Scanner class, and println formatting.

This program works by asking the user to choose between Paper, Scissors, or Rock.  The program then utilized the random class to randomly pick a number 0 through 2, each corresponding with either Paper, Scissors or Rock.  The program outputs whether or not the user won, how they won, or if it was a draw.  The user can quit by pressing 'q' at the start of the match.
